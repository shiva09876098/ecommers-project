# Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and sales performance for an e-commerce dataset. It aims to identify customer segments, evaluate discount effectiveness, and provide tailored insights for improving customer engagement and retention. The dataset includes over 55,000 customer transactions, providing insights into sales performance, discounts availed, and customer purchasing behavior across product categories.

## Background
This e-commerce platform has a diverse customer base, segmented by demographics and purchasing behavior. The goal of the analysis is to enhance marketing strategies by identifying key customer segments (high spenders, discount seekers, and frequent shoppers) and understanding how they impact overall sales performance. By analyzing these segments, the business can improve targeted marketing efforts and optimize discount strategies to increase sales.

## Overall Goal
The overall goal of the project is to improve customer engagement and retention through tailored marketing strategies, focusing on three primary customer segments:
- **High Spenders**
- **Discount Seekers**
- **Frequent Shoppers**

## Business Question
**How can tailored marketing strategies based on customer segmentation improve customer engagement and retention by 20-30%?**

## Process Overview
1. **Microsoft Excel**: 
   - Initial data exploration, cleaning, and preparation for analysis.
   
2. **SQL**:
   - Wrote SQL queries to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Analyzed sales performance by product category and calculated discount effectiveness.
   
3. **Tableau**:
   - Created interactive visualizations to present customer segmentation, sales performance, and other key metrics.
   - Developed a dashboard to visualize insights such as the impact of discounts and sales trends.

## Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
- **Customer Segments**:
   - High spenders contribute significantly to total sales, despite being a smaller percentage of the customer base.
   - Discount seekers actively look for deals and make a high percentage of their purchases with discounts.
   - Frequent shoppers make regular purchases and show higher engagement.

- **Sales Performance**:
   - Electronics and Apparel dominate total sales, making up a large percentage of overall revenue.
   - Categories like Apparel see a higher impact from discounts, while categories like Electronics maintain strong sales without heavy discounting.

- **Discount Effectiveness**:
   - Discounts are highly effective for certain customer segments but may not drive as much revenue for high spenders who are less price-sensitive.
